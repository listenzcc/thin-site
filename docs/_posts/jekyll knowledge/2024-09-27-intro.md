The intro for the notebook

[toc]

## Notebook

It is the notebook for a long term usage.
It is the diary, programming cookbook and data station, for my knowledge and receiving in daily life.
So, I have prepared three folders for the notebook.

## Folders

### Thin

The talk is cheap, but worth.
So the [thin](./thin) folder contains the markdown documents.
It is also the Jekyll driven static web page giving a better readability for the documents.
I plan to upload it into the github repository, so others can see it.

$$\text{Equation example}, \alpha, \beta$$

### Fat

The data is so large in the other hand, to be available in the github repository.
So I plan to ship the data in to the [fat](./fat) folder.

### Program

The long and useful programming scripts and their compiles are in the [program](./program/) folder.
I wish them to work well with the [fat](./fat) folder.
